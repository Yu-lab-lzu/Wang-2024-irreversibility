# Wang-2024-irreversibility
 

The data and code for the paper: Irreversibility as a signature of non-equilibrium phase transition in the large-scale human brain networks: An fMRI study

The above contains all the code for this work. The first part calculates and decomposes the irreversibility of the brain under different task states, while the second part calculates the irreversibility during the phase transition process of the large-scale brain network.

Some data with strict-access of HCP were not shared. If you have any questions, please contact me:jingwang21@lzu.edu.cn
