function T = transitions_slidingWindow_variableLengths(spike_times, cell_IDs, cells, dt, trial_lengths)
% Input: cell array of spike times (in ms) for different stimulus repeats
% (where spike_times{i} gives the array of spike times in repeat i), cell
% array of cell IDs in order of spiking (where cell_IDs{i} gives the array
% of cells that spiked in repeat i), the subset of cells that we want to
% study cells, the width of the time window dt (in ms), and array
% trial_lengths where trial_lengths(i) is the length of trial i (in ms).
%
% Output: Calculate state transitions in the following way. We move a
% sliding window of width dt and record the transitions between binary
% states. For times with simultaneous spikes, we pick a random order. We
% return the 2^n x n matrix of transition counts T, where n is the number
% of cells. For example, T(i,j) is the number of times cell j flipped when
% in state i.
